# Hello World of Machine Learning

This is a simple project to see the difference between some machine learning algorithms and to see how they work recognizing handwritten digits using the famous MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run all the cells in the notebook. One by one or all at once.
3. Enjoy the results.
